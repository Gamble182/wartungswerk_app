## Executive Summary

WartungsWerk (brand name: Drehmoment) addresses a €20,000/year opportunity cost for self-employed heating technicians (Heizungsbauer) in Germany by replacing manual Excel-based maintenance management with automated, mobile-first scheduling and customer reminders.

**Core Insight:** Max spends 8 hours/week on administrative overhead. Our solution reduces this to <2 hours/week, freeing 6 hours for billable work worth ~€240/week or €12,480/year.

## 4. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### 4.1 Critical Risks

**RISK-BIZ-002: No demand for SaaS beyond Max**
- **Probability:** Medium (40%)
- **Impact:** High (no revenue, no scale)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Beta program with 5-10 users validates demand before SaaS investment
  - Gather testimonials and case studies
  - Test pricing willingness with beta group
  - Launch MVP features only (avoid over-building)
- **Contingency:** If <3 beta sign-ups, reassess product-market fit or pivot

- **Impact:** Medium (harder differentiation)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Speed to market (8-10 week MVP)

## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1 Go Decision

**✅ RECOMMENDED: PROCEED WITH MVP**

**Rationale:**
1. **Strong validation:** Max has committed €3,000 and will be active user
2. **Clear pain point:** €20,000/year opportunity cost is quantified and real
3. **Low risk:** Bootstrap model, free hosting, MVP-first approach
4. **Market opportunity:** 15,000 potential customers, underserved by current solutions
5. **Scalability:** Clear path from MVP → Beta → SaaS
6. **Unit economics:** Extremely favorable (95% margin, 26:1 LTV:CAC potential)

### 6.2 Critical Success Factors

1. **Max must adopt:** Everything hinges on Max using daily
2. **Simplicity:** Resist feature bloat, focus on core workflow
3. **Mobile-first:** Must work flawlessly on smartphone
4. **Offline-capable:** Essential for on-site usage
5. **Speed to market:** 8-10 weeks critical for Max's business needs

### 6.3 Phase Sequencing

**Do NOT skip steps:**
1. ✅ MVP with Max (validate product)
2. ✅ Beta with 5-10 users (validate demand)
3. ✅ SaaS launch (validate market)
4. ✅ Scale (after validation)

Attempting to skip directly to SaaS without validation risks building wrong product.

### 6.4 Key Strategic Decisions

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Recommend 3-tier model (€29/€49/€99)
- Start with Solo tier for MVP/Beta
- Add Professional tier at SaaS launch
- Add Enterprise tier after 50+ customers

**Feature Prioritization:**
- MVP: ONLY customer mgmt + wartung tracking + email automation
- Phase 2: Calendar, invoicing, reports
- Phase 3: Multi-user, API, integrations

**Marketing Strategy:**
- Organic-first (SEO, content) to control CAC
- Paid only after organic channels validated
- Partnerships for distribution scale
