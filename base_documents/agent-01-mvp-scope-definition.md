# MVP Scope Definition & Feature Prioritization - WartungsWerk

**Phase:** MVP Planning
**Date:** December 11, 2024
**Agent:** Business Strategy Agent
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope for WartungsWerk, targeting 8-10 weeks development timeline with single-user (Max) focus. The MVP validates core value proposition: **reducing Max's admin time from 8h/week to <2h/week through automated maintenance management**.

**MVP Success Criteria:**
- Max uses app daily
- Admin time reduced by 75% (6 hours saved/week)
- Zero missed appointments in first 3 months
- Max willing to recommend to colleagues

---

## 1. MVP Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principle

**"Simple enough to build in 8 weeks, valuable enough Max can't live without it."**

The MVP must:
- ✅ Solve Max's BIGGEST pain point (time waste + missed appointments)
- ✅ Be usable immediately (no manual required)
- ✅ Work on smartphone (Max's primary device)
- ✅ Work offline (customer sites without internet)
- ✅ Demonstrate clear time savings (quantifiable ROI)
- ❌ NOT try to do everything (invoicing, calendar, reports can wait)

### 1.2 MVP vs. Full Vision

| Capability | MVP (8 weeks) | Phase 2 (Beta) | Phase 3 (SaaS) |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Customer Management | ✅ Basic CRUD | Advanced search/filters | Tags, custom fields |
| Maintenance Tracking | ✅ Manual completion | Checklists, signatures | Templates, analytics |
| Email Automation | ✅ 4-week & 1-week reminders | Configurable timing | A/B testing, personalization |
| Mobile | ✅ PWA, offline-capable | Push notifications | Native app features |
| Calendar | ❌ Phase 2 | ✅ Manual scheduling | Google Calendar sync |
| Invoicing | ❌ Phase 2 | ✅ Basic invoices | Lexoffice integration |
| Reporting | ❌ Phase 3 | Basic dashboard | Advanced analytics |
| Multi-User | ❌ Phase 3 | ❌ Phase 3 | ✅ Roles & permissions |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)

### 6.1 Performance

**Target Device:** iPhone 12 / Samsung Galaxy S21 (mid-range smartphone)
**Target Network:** 3G (slow mobile connection)

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| Initial page load (cold start) | <3 seconds | <5 seconds |
| Customer list load | <2 seconds | <3 seconds |
| Wartung completion | <1 second | <2 seconds |
| Photo upload (per photo) | <3 seconds | <5 seconds |
| API response time (p95) | <500ms | <1000ms |

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Code splitting (load only needed JS)

- Database indexing (on customer name, next_maintenance date)

### 6.2 Reliability

- **Uptime:** 99.5% (3.6 hours downtime/month acceptable for MVP)
- **Data Loss:** 0% (no acceptable data loss)
- **Offline Resilience:** App must work 100% offline for core features

### 6.3 Usability

- **Learning Time:** Max should understand system in <30 minutes without manual
- **Task Efficiency:** Core tasks (add customer, complete maintenance) <60 seconds each
- **Error Tolerance:** Forgiving UI (undo, confirmation dialogs, autosave)
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA (minimum 4.5:1 contrast, keyboard navigation)

### 6.4 Compatibility

**Browsers:**

## 7. Risks & Mitigation

### 7.1 MVP-Specific Risks

**RISK-MVP-001: Max doesn't like the UI/UX**
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Impact:** Very High (MVP fails)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Early mockups shared with Max (Sprint 1)
  - Weekly demos during development
  - Max tests on HIS phone (not simulator)
  - Iterative design based on feedback
- **Contingency:** Redesign critical screens if Max confused

**RISK-MVP-002: Offline sync causes data conflicts**
- **Probability:** Medium (40%)
- **Impact:** Medium (data confusion)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Simple conflict resolution: Last-Write-Wins
  - Log all syncs for debugging
  - Clear user feedback during sync
  - Thorough testing of offline/online transitions
- **Contingency:** Disable offline editing for problem areas, keep offline read-only

**RISK-MVP-003: Email deliverability issues (spam filters)**
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Impact:** High (core value prop fails)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use Resend (good reputation)
  - Configure SPF/DKIM/DMARC correctly
  - Warm sender reputation (start with small batch)
  - Test with multiple email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
  - Monitor bounce/spam rates
- **Contingency:** If spam issues persist, consider transactional email provider like Postmark

**RISK-MVP-004: Photo uploads fail on poor networks**
- **Probability:** Medium (40%)
- **Impact:** Medium (frustrating UX)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Compress photos before upload (max 2MB)
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Background upload (queue for later)
  - Clear progress indicator
- **Contingency:** Allow photo upload later (not during maintenance flow)

**RISK-MVP-005: Max overwhelmed by learning new system**
- **Probability:** Low (20%)
- **Impact:** High (abandonment)
- **Mitigation:**
  - 2-hour intensive training session
  - Step-by-step onboarding in app
  - Tooltips for key features
  - Weekly check-ins first month
  - Max can always call developer for help
- **Contingency:** Simplify UI further, add video tutorials

### 7.2 Technical Risks

**RISK-MVP-006: PWA installation doesn't work on iOS**
- **Probability:** Medium (30%) (iOS has PWA quirks)
- **Impact:** Medium (less "app-like" feel)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test extensively on real iPhone
  - Follow iOS-specific PWA guidelines
  - Provide manual install instructions
- **Contingency:** Treat as web app on iOS, full PWA on Android

**RISK-MVP-007: Service worker caching causes stale data**
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Impact:** Medium (user confusion)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Cache-busting strategy (versioned assets)
  - Stale-while-revalidate pattern
  - Clear cache button in settings
  - Automatic cache refresh on app load
- **Contingency:** Reduce caching aggressiveness, prefer network-first

**RISK-MVP-008: Supabase free tier limits hit**
- **Probability:** Low (10%) (should be sufficient for single user)
- **Impact:** Low (upgrade to paid)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Monitor database size and bandwidth
  - Optimize queries and storage
  - Compress photos aggressively
- **Contingency:** Upgrade to Supabase Pro ($25/month) if needed
