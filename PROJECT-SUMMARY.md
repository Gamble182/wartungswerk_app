## ⚠️ Critical Success Factors

### MUST-DO Before Go-Live

**Legal & Compliance:**
- [ ] Double opt-in email flow 100% complete and tested
- [ ] Unsubscribe mechanism working
- [ ] Datenschutzerklärung created and linked
- [ ] AV-Vertrag signed between Max and platform
- [ ] Supabase EU data center confirmed
- [ ] SPF/DKIM/DMARC configured correctly

**Technical:**
- [ ] App works offline (tested in airplane mode)
- [ ] Photo uploads work on slow connection
- [ ] Email reminders send at correct times (test with cron)
- [ ] PWA installable on Max's iPhone
- [ ] Performance: <3s initial load on 3G

**Business:**
- [ ] Max trained (2-hour session completed)
- [ ] Max's customers migrated from Excel
- [ ] Max satisfied with app (feedback collected)

### Top Risks to Mitigate

**RISK #1: Max doesn't adopt the system**
- **Mitigation:** Intensive training, weekly check-ins, extreme simplicity focus
- **Contingency:** If not adopted after 4 weeks, major redesign or pivot

**RISK #2: Email deliverability issues**
- **Mitigation:** Use Resend, configure DNS correctly, monitor bounce rates
- **Contingency:** Switch to Postmark or SendGrid if problems persist

**RISK #3: Offline sync causes data conflicts**
- **Mitigation:** Last-Write-Wins strategy, log all conflicts, clear user feedback
- **Contingency:** Disable offline editing, keep offline read-only if conflicts >1%

**RISK #4: GDPR violation (emails without consent)**
- **Mitigation:** Double opt-in MANDATORY, legal review €500-1,000
- **Contingency:** Immediate cease of email sending, legal consultation

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Decisions

### Why This Tech Stack?

**Next.js:** Full-stack in one framework, excellent DX, Vercel-optimized
**TypeScript:** Type safety prevents bugs, excellent for large codebase
**Prisma:** Type-safe database access, automatic migrations
**Supabase:** Free PostgreSQL, EU data center (GDPR), built-in storage
**PWA:** Single codebase for web/iOS/Android, no app store approval needed
**Resend:** Developer-friendly email API, good deliverability

### Why Not X?

**Why not native app?** PWA faster to market, no app store delays, instant updates
**Why not Laravel/Django?** JavaScript ecosystem for full-stack, easier to find developers
**Why not MongoDB?** Relational data (customers → heaters), PostgreSQL more robust
**Why not SendGrid?** Resend more developer-friendly, better DX
**Why not Firebase?** Vendor lock-in concerns, Supabase more PostgreSQL-standard

### Critical Design Decisions

1. **Offline-First:** Essential for on-site usage without internet
2. **Mobile-First:** Max uses phone 80% of the time
3. **Single-Tenant MVP:** Multi-tenant architecture from day 1 (easier scaling later)
4. **Double Opt-In:** GDPR compliance is non-negotiable for German market
5. **Last-Write-Wins:** Simple conflict resolution sufficient for single-user MVP
6. **PWA over Native:** Faster MVP, can always build native later if needed
7. **Monolith over Microservices:** Simpler architecture, easier to develop/deploy
8. **Free Tier Hosting:** Validate product before spending on infrastructure
